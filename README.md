Simple experiments:

For now those can be found in the "exp" folder.

Deep Reinforcement learning:

The codebase was forked around February 2018 from the open AI baselines repository (https://github.com/openai/baselines).
The baselines repo has now changed significantly. I will update the code in this repository with the newer open AI implementation in the future and perform benchmarks. 

The implementation of temporal regularization is straightforward. We modify the target of PPO using exponential smoothing. The modifications can be found in the file baselines/ppo1/pposgd_simple.py at the function add_vtarg_and_adv.
